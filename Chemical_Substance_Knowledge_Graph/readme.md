# Chemical Substance Graph Analysis

## Overview

This project uses a graph database (Neo4j) to analyze the relationships between chemical substances, their exposure concentrations in various water bodies, and their associated hazards to different species. The graph database allows for intuitive exploration of these relationships and offers a foundation for more complex queries and analysis.

## Features

- **Data Relationships**: Explore connections between chemical substances, exposure concentrations, and species-specific hazards.
- **Simple Queries**: Retrieve and visualize basic relationships in the data.
- **Advanced Queries**: Perform complex analyses to gain deeper insights into the chemical hazards.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
